During these days of COVID-19, I thought a lot about those concepts and suggestions popping up regularly on social media dealing with "learn something new, cause there's time for it now". So far so good. As a self-taught programmer, the concept of lifelong and intrinsically motivated learning is nothing new to me. Also, my point of view regarding lifelong learning hasn't changed due to those social media echos. Hacking myself has been and will always be important. 

Somehow all these mentioned above "thinking about lifelong learning" phases during the last few days brought up the conclusion that my own concept and approach require optimizations. For too long these approaches of "read/watch something, try/fail in it" have lasted and thus need to evolve. In case you're still reading this article, you're already part of the game and amid a first step to initiate the optimization: **`Life Hacking Weekly`**. Articles, including content I want to share and note on things I investigated time on or tried to learn within the last 7 days + its important details and conclusions.

## Life Hacking Weekly - why?

Some weeks ago I saw a [great video on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ7lkF7iWtc) created by Preethi Kasireddy, a woman whom I follow on social media since she started to share her journey on learning how to code. The video is part of a series that deals with the topic "How to learn". It includes some really good points on how to come closer to desired learning results or how to deal with setbacks you experience when learning something new.

During this video series at one point, she mentioned the importance of keeping track of your learning progress or actions and gadgets that support your learning progress. Keeping track of learning progress? Never done so far, just tried and failed, tried and failed. So here we are. Remembering this tip of Preethi Kasireddy combined with my thoughts about the "learning something new" social media pop-ups represent the causing mixture of `Life Hacking weekly` articles coming up in the future. Those articles will include personal notes, relevant details and progress trackings about different topics. All of that will deal with very much personal experience and preference, so in the end, there will be no urgent need for you to read those articles, right :)? But as a programmer and fan of open source software, sharing knowledge and experiences is part of my personal nature. That's why this is going to happen public and might let you profit in the form of inspiration considering your own lifelong learning goals and journey.

## Tech only? No, absolutely no. Not this time.

It's important to mention that bringing up this concept of `Life Hacking Weekly` has to differentiate compared to my approach that happened so far. My past and conscious approach to lifelong learning had a massive focus on tech and programming related stuff. But of course - besides that - a lot of learning progress has taken place besides programming, it just didn't matter that much... But hey, now it's called `LIFE Hacking Weekly`, right? Well, life is more than Javascript, ReactJS and other technologies. Because life is: Javascript ;), sports, psychology, cooking, nutrition, keep calm and do whatever, finances, etc. etc.

In case you follow some of the upcoming `Life Hacking Weekly` articles, make sure you read everything considering that the listed topics and learnings are just things I spent time on and probably liked. That does not mean I'm able to do or execute those things well and profoundly. Also, it's not said that I'm going to follow concepts and learnings after they got noted here. Remember: the idea behind this is to consciously resume and take note of personal progress and supportive add-ons, not to plan and fix the personal future and profession.
